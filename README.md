# Overview
- This project was a Christmas present to Noor. 
- The goal of the game is for Sesame to find and eat the hidden treats before Noor returns. 
- Another goal was to put into practice the concepts and software design lessons I learned while completing the Pong and Tetris tutorials.

# Notes
- The software used to make the sprites and background is an online pixel editor called Piskel.

# Final Comments
- This was definitely a challenge for me since I don't focus a lot on artwork aside from music.
